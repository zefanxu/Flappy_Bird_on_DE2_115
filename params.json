{"name":"Flappy Bird Game on DE2 115","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the Project Page\r\nThis is my class project for ECE 385 Digital System Laboratory. ECE 385 is a great class to learn Verilog and it is also a great opportunity for me to develop my own hardware project like this one.\r\n\r\n### Hardware \r\nThis project is instantiated on Altera DE2-115 development board, connected with one VGA monitor @ 720P60Hz and a PS2 keyboard. \r\n\r\n### Flappy Bird Game\r\nEveryone loves game that is simple and addictive, like Flappy Bird. What the gamer only needs to do is to press SPACE to make the bird jump once at a time, so that it will survive through the pipes and get points. We designed the project to add more feature into it. Feel bored playing alone? No problem, you can add an AI player into the game to play with you. The AI will never fail, but maybe you will beat it, who knows. Also, you can play with your friend simultaneously and compete with each other. Much more fun to beat your friend. :-)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nZefan Xu\r\n\r\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering\r\n\r\nUniversity of Illinois\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail me: zefanxu2@illinois.edu\r\n\r\nwww.zefanxu.com","google":"UA-74432762-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
